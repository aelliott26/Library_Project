> Montessori Elementary Library Proposal

## 1. Overall Organization

1. How should the library organize its shelves?

> Creating a library for children should be simple, intuitive, and easily understandable for young children. 

> Books should be separated into broad and easily recognizable categories, such as fiction, non-fiction, and graphic novels.

> With fiction, they should be organized via author last name.

> With non-fiction, they should be sorted into sub-groups that are easily recognizable for children, which would help them in learning about a topic they are curious about, writing a project about, etc. For example, animals, space, science, etc.

2. Should it follow a traditional system (e.g., Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress) or adapt it?

> Again, the books should be sorted in a way that is simple and easy to understand. Since Dewey Decimal is a very commonly used system in many school libraries, a simplified version of this would be a great fit for an Elementary school.

> Instead of using numbers in the Dewey Decimal system, instead use broad categories like stated earlier.

> This system of storing books balances the time to sort with ease of retrieval.

3. Should special categories (e.g., large print, themed displays) be handled differently?

> Yes, special categories should be handled differently.

> Large print books could be kept in an easily found location for younger kids and those with poor eyesight to aid them in reading.

> Themed displays like books in a curriculum or very popular books should also be in easily accessable designated spaces as it makes retreiving popular books much easier, therefore saving time.
