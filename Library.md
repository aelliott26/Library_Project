> Montessori Elementary Library Proposal

## 1. Overall Organization

### 1. How should the library organize its shelves?

> Creating a library for children should be simple, intuitive, and easily understandable for young children. 

> Books should be separated into broad and easily recognizable categories, such as fiction, non-fiction, and graphic novels.

> With fiction, they should be organized via the author's last name.

> Non-fiction should be sorted into easily recognizable sub-groups for children, which would help them learn about a topic they are curious about, writing a project about, etc. For example, animals, space, science, etc.

### 2. Should it follow a traditional system (e.g., Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress) or adapt it?

> Again, the books should be sorted in a way that is simple and easy to understand for children yet does not take too much time to sort. Since Dewey Decimal is a commonly used system in many school libraries, a simplified version would be a great fit for an Elementary school.

> Instead of using numbers in the Dewey Decimal system, use broad categories like stated earlier.

> This system of storing books balances the time to sort with ease of retrieval.

### 3. Should special categories (e.g., large print, themed displays) be handled differently?

> Yes, special categories should be handled differently.

> Large print books could be kept in an easily found location for younger kids and those with poor eyesight to aid them in reading.

> Themed displays like books in a curriculum or very popular books should also be in easily accessible designated spaces as it makes retrieving popular books much easier, therefore saving time.

## 2. Retrieval & Discovery

### 1. How should users find books? Consider catalogs, browsing systems, and digital tools.

> Students should find books through a system of browsing. 

> With the books sorted as stated above, if a student knows what type of genre they like, they can browse the books by genre, or they can browse based on their research topic.

> To help students find books, the current catalog can be used to help students find what area the book will be in. For example, Magic Tree House would have a fantasy tag, which means it can be found in the fantasy section.

### 2. What happens when many people want the same book?

> When many people want the same book, and it has already been checked out, they should use the already established library reserve feature on the library's catalog, and from there, it goes to whoever reserved it first.

### 3. Should the library prioritize ease of retrieval or discovery of new books?

> For an elementary school library, the discovery of new books should be prioritized.

> Students do not often come into the library knowing exactly what book they want. Instead, they generally understand what they like and are interested in.

> Finding a book in a genre related to a student's interests can motivate them to read more and enjoy their reading.

## 3. Return Process
