> Montessori Elementary Library Proposal

## 1. Overall Organization

1. How should the library organize its shelves?

> Creating a library for children should be simple, intuitive, and easily understandable for young children. 

> Books should be separated into broad and easily recognizable categories, such as fiction, non-fiction, and graphic novels.

> With fiction, they should be organized via author last name.

> With non-fiction, they should be sorted into sub-groups that are easily recognizable for children, which would help them in learning about a topic they are curious about, writing a project about, etc. For example, animals, space, science, etc.

2. Should it follow a traditional system (e.g., Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress) or adapt it?

> Again, the books should be sorted in a way that is simple and easy to understand for children, yet does not take too much time to sort. Since Dewey Decimal is a very commonly used system in many school libraries, a simplified version of this would be a great fit for an Elementary school.

> Instead of using numbers in the Dewey Decimal system, instead use broad categories like stated earlier.

> This system of storing books balances the time to sort with ease of retrieval.

3. Should special categories (e.g., large print, themed displays) be handled differently?

> Yes, special categories should be handled differently.

> Large print books could be kept in an easily found location for younger kids and those with poor eyesight to aid them in reading.

> Themed displays like books in a curriculum or very popular books should also be in easily accessable designated spaces as it makes retreiving popular books much easier, therefore saving time.

## 2. Retrieval & Discovery

## 3. Return Process

1. Outline an efficient return system from the user back to the shelves. 

> To make it easier for the young children at Montessori, the user of the book should only have to return it at the front desk/a cart of returned, unsorted books.

> Books should have a tag on the spine that notes whether they are fiction or nonfiction, if they're fiction, they should have the author's last name on them. If they're non-fiction, they should have a Dewey Decimal number on them. This will allow the librarians to resort them more easily.

2. Consider collection points, reshelving frequency, and error handling (e.g., misplaced books). 

> Other possible collection points could be book bins, where books are slid into a slit and cannot be taken back out unless it is by the librarian (this prevents further human error).

> If books are frequently reshelved, consider making a new shelf that is close to the desk to put that category of books in.

> For error handling, assume books have gone missing after a certain amount of time has passed after being checked out (Ex. 3 months). 

3. Are there ever situations where the library might switch strategies (eg if book returns triple during exam season?)

> If the school or library grows in size, or more books are gained, a new sorting strategy could be more efficient.

> Since there should already be an easy-access shelf for curriculum books, there most likely won't be any changes needed if book returns triple during exam season (especially because it is an Elementary school).
